*************************************
This project is to implement a basic shell.
It contains three phases:
	1. single command
	2. basic shell
	3. command shell with background execution
	
run 'make' to compile three phases.
Below also includes our data.

===================PHASE 1=====================
run 'make runCommand' to compile only this phase

to execute, type <./runCommand [command]>, where
you substitute the bracket with desired command.

e.g.
./runCommand ls

this will return all the files in the current 
directory. 

runCommand will only execute one command every
execution.

The result from the above command is as follows:
-------------------------------------------------------
yl@yl-VirtualBox:~/proj1$ ./runCommand ls
aa	    Makefile~	 runCommand	shell2	    shell-a.c  shell-r	     testproj1.zip
aa~	    README~	 runCommand.c	shell2.c    shell.c    test1.txt     test.txt
file2.txt~  README.txt	 runCommand.c~	shell2-r    shell.c~   test1.txt~    test.txt~
Makefile    README.txt~  shell		shell2-r.c  shellq.c   testhandle.c
Time elapsed 0 milliseconds.
system cpu time is 0 millisends.
user cpu time is 0 millisends.
soft page fault is 282 
 hard page fault is 0 
involuntarily context switched 31 times
 voluntarily context switched 1 times
-------------------------------------------------------


===================PHASE 2=====================
run 'make shell' to compile only this phase

to execute, type <./shell >, then follow the prompts

e.g. 
./shell
==>ls
/* shows files in current directory */

==>pwd 
/* shows current location */

shell allows user to execute multiple commands at one execution
of shell.

test2.txt provides more detailed illustration

The result from ./shell <test2.txt is as follows:
-------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------


===================PHASE 3======================
run 'make shell2' to compile only this phase

to execute, type <./shell2>, then follow the prompts

based on shell, shell2 allows user to run background processes.
the processes information will be stored in a linked list, ordered
by their fork time. if a process 4 ends, the upcoming process will 
be number 5, not replacing the finished process. The process 4 will
then be deleted from the linked list, by parsing the list and finding 
its information.

test.txt, testexit.txt, test32.txt, test128.txt provides more detailed illustration

The result from ./shell <test2.txt is as follows:
